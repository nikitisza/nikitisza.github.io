Is it possible to get a designer job without qualification? I'd say it certainly is.

Here is my thoughts on how to become a designer without going to school.



Even the bests were all [beginners](http://vimeo.com/85040589) once. When you land in your first design job, keep learning. This is one of the jobs that will never bore you. There is always so much new to learn and to improve on for example new tool, updates on older software. Never stop learning. This is the **only way** to keep your knowledge sharp and give yourself an edge in order to differentiate yourself from other designers on the job market.
