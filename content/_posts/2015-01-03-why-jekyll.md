I was thinking: what would be the best first post to publish on my new blog?

So, here it goes: why I've chosen Jekyll over Wordpress. Because of its

- **Speed**:  Static HTML pages are small, lightweight and perform fast.

- **Version Control**: Contents and files remain on your computer. Perform backups or keep track of changes via GIT or SVN — *it’s quite easy without a database.*

- **Flexibility**: Ruby and Liquid — *Jekyll’s foundation* — empower you to easily extend its functionality. Or just use one of [many plugins](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/) created by a striving community.

- **Security**: Anything you’ll ever put on your server are static files — chances are good that *you’ll never need to worry* about security concerns anymore.

I also wanted to try something completely new that I've never used before, and something that I can host free on Github under [my name](https://github.com/nikitisza). I needed few days to get my head around it, and I'm still learning...

If you'd like to give it a try just go over to the [Jekyll website](http://jekyllrb.com/) and you can see for yourself. Or if you prefer here is a less geeky [article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) about it.

**Enjoy!**
