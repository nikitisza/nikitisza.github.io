**Hello there**, welcome to my blog. 

I have always enjoyed art from an early age. My earliest memory of this is doodling on paper. I can remember spending most of my childhood just drawing and being inspired to make and design anything and everything. This love of art has stayed with me and developed and grown, however I worked in many other industries before coming back to design a few years ago. Since Iâ€™ve been working for both startups and worldwide known companies internationally in Ireland, Hungary and New Zealand.

Continuous learning has been always big part of my life, although I feel most of my skills have been self-taught through experimentation and following the work and tutorials of others. At the moment, I design experiences for all digital products such as websites, web apps and mobile apps (for tablet and phone too). I also do front-end development and I'm keen on learning more back-end dev too. Also I study part-time towards a master degree in design innovation.

In my free time (when I'm not learning something), I love to write, draw, paint, sew, cook, train, hunting good coffee and walking with my dog.
